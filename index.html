            <p>
                Now you all know <br>
                The bards and their songs <br>
                When hours have gone by <br>
                I'll close my eyes <br>
                In a world far away <br>
                We may meet again <br>
                But now hear my song <br>
                About the dawn of the night <br>
                Let's sing the bards' song <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Tomorrow will take us away  <br>
                Far from home <br>
                No one will ever know our names <br>
                But the bards' songs will remain <br>
                Tomorrow will take it away <br>
                The fear of today <br>
                It will be gone <br>
                Due to our magic songs <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                There's only one song <br>
                Left in my mind <br>
                Tales of a brave man <br>
                Who lived far from here <br>
                Now the bard songs are over <br>
                And it's time to leave <br>
                No one should ask you for the name <br>
                Of the one <br>
                Who tells the story <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Tomorrow will take us away <br>
                Far from home <br>
                No one will ever know our names <br>
                But the bards' songs will remain <br>
                Tomorrow all will be known <br>
                And you're not alone <br>
                So don't be afraid <br>
                In the dark and cold <br>
                'Cause the bards' songs will remain <br>
                They all will remain <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In my thoughts and in my dreams <br>
                They're always in my mind <br>
                These songs of hobbits, dwarves and men <br>
                And elves <br>
                Come close your eyes <br>
                You can see them too <br>
